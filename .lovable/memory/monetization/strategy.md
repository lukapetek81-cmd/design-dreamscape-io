**Source of truth**: `PREMIUM_COMMODITIES` set in `supabase/functions/_shared/commodity-mappings.ts` (mirrored as `PREMIUM_ENERGY` in `oil-price-api/index.ts`).

**Cache TTL**: 2 hours (was 1h). Halves API burn. Spot prices don't move enough hourly to justify the cost.

**Enforcement**:
- `fetch-all-commodities` reads JWT → checks `profiles.subscription_active && subscription_tier !== 'free'` → passes `includePremium` to `CommodityService.fetchAllCommodities()`.
- `oil-price-api` filters batch requests against `PREMIUM_ENERGY` unless `includePremium: true` in body.
- Cache keyed per-flag (`all-commodities:free` vs `all-commodities:premium`) — no cross-tier leakage.

**Economics rationale**: At $19.99/mo with trimmed catalog + 2h cache, per-subscriber API cost stays well below revenue. Reference: TradingView Pro $14.95, Barchart Premier $33.95.

**Stripe/RevenueCat**: Price IDs must be updated separately in the billing dashboard — code only references generic checkout.

**Frontend**: `useAuth().isPremium` is the canonical client-side check. Edge functions re-verify via JWT — never trust client claims.
